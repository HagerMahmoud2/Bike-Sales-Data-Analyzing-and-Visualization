# introduction:
There’s been recent concerns over the occasional running out of stock, so the company wants to know the most sold products, and what time of the year sales peak in order to know when to stock up.
# Description:
The dataset I analyzed comprised 13 columns and 1,027 rows, focusing on bike sales. It encompassed customer information and demographics related to bike purchases.
These columns included customer ID, marital status, gender, income, number of children, education level, occupation, homeownership status, car ownership, commute distance, region, age, and bike purchase status.

# REFERENCE: 
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
# DATA PREPARATION STEPS:
1. Understanding the Dataset: Before delving into any analysis, it’s crucial to thoroughly comprehend the dataset.
2. Preserving Data Integrity: I made a duplicate of the original dataset in a separate sheet. This precaution ensures the original data remains intact, providing a safety net in case of errors or data corruption.
3. Data Cleaning Procedures: (If you want to know more about data cleaning you can check this out https://bit.ly/3teg0X1)
4. Removing Duplicates: Duplicate entries within a dataset can lead to inaccuracies and confusion. Hence, I opted to eliminate duplicates using Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” feature found in the “Data” tab under the “Data tools” section.
